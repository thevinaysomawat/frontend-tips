{"pageProps":{"content":"\r\nBy default, the browser will download all images found on a page no matter where they are located. To improve the user experience, we often use the [Intersection Observer API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API) or external libraries to lazy load images.\r\n\r\nThe lazy loading means that an image is only downloaded to the client when it's available in the browser's viewport.\r\n\r\nIn the latest version of Chromium-powered (including Chrome, Edge and Opera) and Firefox browsers support it natively with the `loading=\"lazy\"` attribute:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<img src=\"...\" alt=\"...\" loading=\"lazy\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe browser now will defer the loading of images until they are visible in the viewport.\r\n\r\nIt's common to see that the layout is shifted when an image is loaded completely. To avoid the issue, it's recommended to set the size of image using either inline styles or the attributes:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"height: 200px; width: 300px;\" />\r\n\r\n<!-- Or -->\r\n<img loading=\"lazy\" height=\"200\" width=\"300\" />\r\n```\r\n","frontMatter":{"title":"Lazy loading images with the loading attribute","category":"Tip","date":"2021-04-12 10:28:00 +7","topics":"HTML"},"prevPost":{"slug":"keep-the-calculation-of-a-magic-number","title":"Keep the calculation of a magic number"},"nextPost":{"slug":"list-branches-sorted-by-most-recent-commit-date","title":"List branches sorted by most recent commit date"}},"__N_SSG":true}
