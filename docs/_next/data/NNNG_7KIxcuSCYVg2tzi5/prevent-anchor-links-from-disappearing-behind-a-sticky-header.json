{"pageProps":{"content":"\r\n[Sticky headers](https://csslayout.io/patterns/sticky-header) is a common layout that can be seen in a lot of websites. The problem is that it doesn't play nicely with anchor links.\r\n\r\nImagine that we have a table of contents that contains different anchor links. Each anchor brings the user to a particular section in the page.\r\n\r\nWhen users click an anchor, the page scrolls to the destination section. But some parts of the section are displayed under the header which is not a good experience for users.\r\n\r\nTo prevent it from happening, we would like to add a margin to the top of the destination, but it only has effect when scrolling. It's the time where the scroll-margin-top comes in handy.\r\n\r\n```css\r\nheader {\r\n    height: 2rem;\r\n}\r\n\r\nsection {\r\n    scroll-margin-top: 2rem;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### See also\r\n\r\n-   [Smooth scrolling with pure CSS](/smooth-scrolling-with-pure-css.html)\r\n","frontMatter":{"title":"Prevent anchor links from disappearing behind a sticky header","category":"Tip","date":"2021-03-24 13:56:00 +7","topics":"CSS"},"prevPost":{"slug":"prevent-a-string-from-being-escaped","title":"Prevent a string from being escaped"},"nextPost":{"slug":"prevent-browsers-from-asking-to-translate","title":"Prevent browsers from asking to translate"}},"__N_SSG":true}
