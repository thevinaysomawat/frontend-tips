{"pageProps":{"content":"\r\nIf the contents of a website are written in a particular language, the visitors might be prompted to translate them into another language when using certain browsers ([Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome), for example).\r\n\r\nYou can prevent this from happening by setting the `translate` attribute for the whole document:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<html translate=\"no\"></html>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `translate` attribute has an effect on some translation tools such as [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com).\r\n\r\nMoreover, it's a global attribute meaning that we can use it for any elements. It's very useful if we don't want to translate a brand name even if the page is translated:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<footer>(c) 2021 <span translate=\"no\">Brand Name</span></footer>\r\n```\r\n","frontMatter":{"title":"Prevent browsers from asking to translate","category":"Tip","date":"2021-04-06 13:00:00 +7","topics":"HTML"},"prevPost":{"slug":"prevent-anchor-links-from-disappearing-behind-a-sticky-header","title":"Prevent anchor links from disappearing behind a sticky header"},"nextPost":{"slug":"prevent-macos-from-going-to-sleep","title":"Prevent macOS from going to sleep"}},"__N_SSG":true}
