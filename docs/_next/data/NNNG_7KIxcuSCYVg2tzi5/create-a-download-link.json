{"pageProps":{"content":"\r\nIt's common to use an `a` tag to create a download link. The browser will open the file for some well-supported file types, such as image, pdf, etc.\r\n\r\nIf you want to enforce the browser to download the file, then use the HTML 5 `download` attribute. The value of attribute, if specified, will be used as the name of download file.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<!-- Download instead of openning it -->\r\n<a href=\"/assets/document.pdf\" download>\r\n    <!-- Download it with new file name -->\r\n    <a href=\"/assets/document.pdf\" download=\"a copy of document.pdf\"></a\r\n></a>\r\n```\r\n\r\n> It's worth noting that the `download` attribute only works if the file belongs to the same domain as the current website. It doesn't have effect if the `href` attribute has the different origin to the site\r\n","frontMatter":{"title":"Create a download link","category":"Tip","date":"2021-03-01 14:13:00 +7","topics":"HTML"},"prevPost":{"slug":"create-a-descending-list-of-numbered-items","title":"Create a descending list of numbered items"},"nextPost":{"slug":"create-a-file-of-any-size","title":"Create a file of any size"}},"__N_SSG":true}
