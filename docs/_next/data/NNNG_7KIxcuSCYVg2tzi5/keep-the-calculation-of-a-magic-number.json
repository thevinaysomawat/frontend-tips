{"pageProps":{"content":"\r\nLet's say that we want to calculate the number of [difference days](https://1loc.dev/#calculate-the-number-of-difference-days-between-two-dates) between two given dates.\r\nBy simply using the `-` operator, it's easy for us to calculate the differences between two date objects, `date` and `otherDate` for example:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst diff = Math.abs(date - otherDate);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe function returns the number of milliseconds. In order to get the number of days, we have to divide it by `86400000`:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nMath.ceil(diff / 86400000);\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe know that `86400000` is the total number of milliseconds in a day. The code is still working fine until there's another people on the team looking at it, and it takes them time to realize what the number `86400000` is.\r\n\r\nTo make the code more readable and easy to maintain, we should replace the magic number with its calculation:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// Better version\r\nconst diffDays = (date, otherDate) => Math.ceil((Math.abs(date - otherDate) / 1000) * 60 * 60 * 24);\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf the number is used across different places, for example when we create a library for manipulating dates, then it's recommended to declare the magic number as a constant:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// The best version\r\n// constants.js\r\nconst MILLISECOND_DAY = 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24;\r\nexport { MILLISECOND_DAY };\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen reuse it later:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport { MILLISECOND_DAY } from './constants';\r\n\r\nconst diffDays = (date, otherDate) => Math.ceil(Math.abs(date - otherDate) / MILLISECOND_DAY);\r\n```\r\n\r\n### See also\r\n\r\n-   [Do not use magic numbers when manipulating strings](/do-not-use-magic-numbers-when-manipulating-strings.html)\r\n","frontMatter":{"title":"Keep the calculation of a magic number","category":"Best practice","date":"2021-03-11 19:34:00 +7","topics":"JavaScript"},"prevPost":{"slug":"inspect-an-element-shown-on-hover","title":"Inspect an element shown on hover"},"nextPost":{"slug":"lazy-loading-images-with-the-loading-attribute","title":"Lazy loading images with the loading attribute"}},"__N_SSG":true}
