{"pageProps":{"content":"\r\nHave you ever seen a class name starting with `js-`?\r\n\r\nIf the answer is not, then you can visit the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/phuoc-ng/frontend-tips) and see the source of generated HTML. There are bunch of elements whose class are prefixed with `js-` such as:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<meta class=\"js-ga-set\" name=\"userId\" content=\"...\" /> <meta class=\"js-ga-set\" name=\"dimension1\" content=\"...\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\nThey are often used to manage the list of elements that we don't want to set id for (dynamic elements, for example). In these cases, we use the `document.querySelectorAll('js-xxx')` method to retrieve the elements list.\r\n\r\nIn the other words, the `js-` classes don't define the styles, but for managing the elements in JavaScript instead. That's why they are prefixed with `js-`.\r\n\r\nFollow this naming convention is helpful if you're working in a team. Other engineers will be aware of the class name, and don't remove them when refactoring the page.\r\n","frontMatter":{"title":"Prefix class name with js to manipulate with javascript","category":"Best practice","date":"2021-02-23 08:23:00 +7","topics":"DOM, HTML"},"prevPost":{"slug":"pick-the-first-and-last-items-of-an-array","title":"Pick the first and last items of an array"},"nextPost":{"slug":"pretty-format-json","title":"Pretty format JSON"}},"__N_SSG":true}
