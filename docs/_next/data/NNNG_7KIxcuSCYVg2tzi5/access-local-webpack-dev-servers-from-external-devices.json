{"pageProps":{"content":"\r\nSometimes we would like to access a local development server externally. It happens when we want to see how our web application works on mobile phones. Or co-workers want to see how it looks on their browsers.\r\n\r\nThe local server is available at `http://localhost:PORT` where `PORT` represents the port number that the server listens on. In order to make it accessible in the same network, we have to replace `localhost` with the IP address.\r\n\r\nWebpack dev server allows the server to be available externally via the `host` option:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// webpack.config.js\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n  ...\r\n  devServer: {\r\n    host: '0.0.0.0',\r\n    port: 8001,\r\n    ...\r\n  },\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `host` option can be passed to the command line interface as well:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nwebpack serve --host 0.0.0.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith the configurations above, we can access the server internally (`http://localhost:8001`) and externally (`http://THE-IP-ADDRESS:8001`).\r\n","frontMatter":{"title":"Access local webpack dev servers from external devices","category":"Tip","date":"2021-04-26 09:18:00 +7","topics":"Webpack","metadata":{"image":"webpack-dev-server-host-option.png"}},"prevPost":{"slug":"accept-any-numbers-of-parameters","title":"Accept any numbers of parameters"},"nextPost":{"slug":"access-the-selected-node-in-the-console","title":"Access the selected node in the Console"}},"__N_SSG":true}
