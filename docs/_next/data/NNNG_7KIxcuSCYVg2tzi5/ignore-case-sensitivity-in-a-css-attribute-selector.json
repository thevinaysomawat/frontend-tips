{"pageProps":{"content":"\r\nBy default, CSS attribute selectors are case-sensitive. It means that `a[href$=\".png\"]` has effect with the links whose extensions are `.png` only.\r\n\r\nImagine that you're building a files management application. It would add an icon to a file based on its extension. For example, the following CSS inserts an icon to any `.png` file.\r\n\r\n```css\r\na[href$='.png']:after {\r\n    content: url(/img/png.svg);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn reality, the files are uploaded by the users and we can't control the file extensions. A png file can be named as `.png`, `.PNG`, `.pNG`.\r\n\r\nIn order to accept all of these variants, we can add `i` right before `]` in the selector.\r\n\r\n```css\r\na[href$='.png' i]:after {\r\n    content: url(/img/png.svg);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### See also\r\n\r\n-   [Add an icon to external links](/add-an-icon-to-external-links.html)\r\n","frontMatter":{"title":"Ignore case sensitivity in a CSS attribute selector","category":"Tip","date":"2021-03-23 14:24:00 +7","topics":"CSS"},"prevPost":{"slug":"highlight-text-with-the-mark-element","title":"Highlight text with the mark element"},"nextPost":{"slug":"ignore-items-from-array-destructuring","title":"Ignore items from array destructuring"}},"__N_SSG":true}
