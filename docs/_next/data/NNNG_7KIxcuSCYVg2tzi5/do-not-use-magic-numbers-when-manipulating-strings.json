{"pageProps":{"content":"\r\nIt's quite often that we pass the index parameter when using string manipulation functions such as `slice`, `splice`, `substr` or `substring`.\r\n\r\nLet's take a look at a simple example which [converts a given date](https://1loc.dev/#convert-a-date-to-yyyy-mm-dd-format) object to _YYYY-MM-DD_ format.\r\n\r\nGiven a `date` object, we can get the string representing the date in the ISO format:\r\n\r\n```js\r\ndate.toISOString();\r\n// '2021-03-09T01:42:46.002Z'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe output is constructed by different parts which starts with the full date, `2021-03-09` as we see in the example above.\r\nSo, it's easy to get the full date by extracting it from the ISO format:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst format = (date) => date.toISOString().slice(0, 10);\r\n```\r\n\r\n`10` is called a magic number, because when the other people look at the code, they don't have idea where the number comes from.\r\n\r\nRather than using a magic number, it's recommended to explain what it is and how it's calculated:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// The better version\r\nconst FULL_DATE_LENGTH = 'YYYY-MM-DD'.length;\r\n\r\nconst format = (date) => date.toISOString().slice(0, FULL_DATE_LENGTH);\r\n```\r\n\r\n### See also\r\n\r\n-   [Keep the calculation of a magic number](/keep-the-calculation-of-a-magic-number.html)\r\n","frontMatter":{"title":"Do not use magic numbers when manipulating strings","category":"Best practice","date":"2021-03-09 08:34:00 +7","topics":"JavaScript"},"prevPost":{"slug":"do-not-mix-styles-of-an-element-with-its-container","title":"Don't mix styles of an element with its container"},"nextPost":{"slug":"do-not-use-submit-to-name-a-submit-button","title":"Do not use submit to name a submit button"}},"__N_SSG":true}
