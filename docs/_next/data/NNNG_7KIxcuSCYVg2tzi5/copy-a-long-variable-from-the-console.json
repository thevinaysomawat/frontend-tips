The following screenshot shows how you see `console.log(range)` in the _Console_, where `range` is an array of numbers between 0 and 500.\r\n\r\n![long variable in the Console](/img/long-variable-in-console.png)\r\n\r\nIt's not easy to see the full value or copy the content to clipboard. Here is the tip to do that with ease:\r\n\r\n-   In the _Console_, right click the output and click _Store object as global variable_\r\n-   _Console_ creates a temporary variable, `temp1` for example, that holds the variable value\r\n-   Type `temp1 + ''` in the _Console_, and press the _Enter_ key\r\n\r\n_Console_ will try to convert the result to `String`. As a result, you get the full content of original variable.\r\n\r\nHere is the output which was omitted to fit in the screen:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n\"0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,...,\r\n490,491,492,493,494,495,496,497,498,499\"\r\n```\r\n","frontMatter":{"title":"Copy a long variable from the Console","category":"Tip","date":"2021-02-23 22:30:00 +7","topics":"DevTools"},"prevPost":{"slug":"convert-string-to-number","title":"Convert string to number"},"nextPost":{"slug":"copy-screenshots-to-the-clipboard-on-macos","title":"Copy screenshots to the clipboard on macOS"}},"__N_SSG":true}
