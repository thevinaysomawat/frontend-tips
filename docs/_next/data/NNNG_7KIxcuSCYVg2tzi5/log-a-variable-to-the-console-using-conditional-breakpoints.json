For example, when we debug codes coming from external libraries.\r\n\r\nPerform the steps below to print the variable:\r\n\r\n-   Open the Chrome DevTools, and activate the _Sources_ tab\r\n-   Navigate to the line of a given function that you want to log the data\r\n-   Right-click the line number, and choose _Add conditional breakpoint ..._ from the context menu\r\n-   Enter the condition\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconsole.log('replace-it-with-your-variable');\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen the associcate line is hit by the debug process, it will try to evaluate the condition meaning that the variable is printed out.\r\n\r\nThe nice thing is that the script execution on the page is still being processed because the condition never happens (the `console.log` function returns `undefined`).\r\n\r\nIn the following screenshot, the `params` variable is logged to the _Console_ when the `sum` function is invoked.\r\n\r\n![Log with conditional breakpoints](/img/log-conditional-breakpoints.png)\r\n\r\n### See also\r\n\r\n-   [Conditional logging in the Console](/conditional-logging-in-the-console.html)\r\n-   [Log a value to the Console](/log-a-value-to-the-console.html)\r\n-   [Log a variable in an arrow function](/log-a-variable-in-an-arrow-function.html)\r\n-   [Log an array to the Console](/log-an-array-to-the-console.html)\r\n","frontMatter":{"title":"Log a variable to the console using conditional breakpoints","category":"Trick","date":"2021-03-01 20:56:00 +7","topics":"DevTools"},"prevPost":{"slug":"log-a-variable-in-an-arrow-function","title":"Log a variable in an arrow function"},"nextPost":{"slug":"log-an-array-to-the-console","title":"Log an array to the Console"}},"__N_SSG":true}
