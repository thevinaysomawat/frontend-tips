{"pageProps":{"content":"\r\nIf you want to receive the first and last items of a given array, you might think of the common way as following:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst length = arr.length;\r\nconst first = arr[0];\r\nconst last = arr[arr.length - 1];\r\n```\r\n\r\nBecause an array is also an object, the `length` property can be accessed with the destructuring syntax:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst { length } = arr;\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso, an array item at any position can be accessed with its index. Hence, we can shorten three lines at the top with a single line:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst { length, 0: first, [length - 1]: last } = arr;\r\n```\r\n\r\n### See also\r\n\r\n-   [Get characters of a string](/get-characters-of-a-string.html)\r\n-   [Ignore items from array destructuring](/ignore-items-from-array-destructuring.html)\r\n","frontMatter":{"title":"Pick the first and last items of an array","category":"Tip","date":"2021-05-17 20:37:00 +7","topics":"JavaScript","metadata":{"image":"pick-first-last.png"}},"prevPost":{"slug":"pick-given-properties-from-a-json-representation","title":"Pick given properties from a JSON representation"},"nextPost":{"slug":"prefix-class-name-with-js-to-manipulate-with-javascript","title":"Prefix class name with js to manipulate with javascript"}},"__N_SSG":true}
