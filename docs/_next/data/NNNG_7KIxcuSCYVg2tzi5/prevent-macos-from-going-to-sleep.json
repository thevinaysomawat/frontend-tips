However, there are cases we want to prevent it from happening such as during a presentation, downloading a big file.\r\n\r\nmacOS provides a command to do that:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n$ caffeinate\r\n```\r\n\r\nPressing <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> will bring it back to the normal mode.\r\n\r\nThe command also supports the time parameter.
