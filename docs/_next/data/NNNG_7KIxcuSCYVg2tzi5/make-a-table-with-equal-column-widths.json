Fortunately, we can use the `table-layout` property to do that.\r\nNo matter what how many columns the table has, they will have the same widths.\r\n\r\n```css\r\ntable {\r\n    table-layout: fixed;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n","frontMatter":{"title":"Make a table with equal column widths","category":"Tip","date":"2021-03-02 18:54:00 +7","topics":"CSS"},"prevPost":{"slug":"log-the-full-object-in-nodejs","title":"Log the full object in NodeJS"},"nextPost":{"slug":"manage-multiple-boolean-flags","title":"Manage multiple boolean flags"}},"__N_SSG":true}
