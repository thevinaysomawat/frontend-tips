{"pageProps":{"content":"\r\nInstead of repeating colors in a few places, we can define a value for the `color` property once and reuse it with the `currentColor` keyword.\r\n\r\n```css\r\n/* Bad */\r\ndiv {\r\n    color: #d1d5db;\r\n    background-image: linear-gradient(to bottom, #d1d5db, #fff);\r\n}\r\n\r\n/* Good */\r\ndiv {\r\n    color: #d1d5db;\r\n    background-image: linear-gradient(to bottom, currentColor, #fff);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBecause the `color` property of an element, if not specified, is inherited from its parent, we can use the `currentColor` keyword in the children of element.\r\n\r\nFor example, let's say that we want the color of a link to be the same with its container, a given `div` element:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n/* Bad: Declare same color in three places */\r\ndiv {\r\n    color: #fff;\r\n}\r\ndiv a {\r\n    border-bottom: 1px solid #fff;\r\n    color: #fff;\r\n    text-decoration: none;\r\n}\r\n\r\n/* Good */\r\ndiv {\r\n    color: #fff;\r\n}\r\ndiv a {\r\n    border-bottom: 1px solid currentColor;\r\n    color: currentColor;\r\n    text-decoration: none;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n> We often use the `currentColor` keyword in the _camelCase_ format. However, CSS is case-insensitive meaning that `CurrentColor`, `currentcolor` or even `cUrReNtCoLoR` are valid keywords and have the same effect as `currentColor`\r\n","frontMatter":{"title":"Reuse the current color","category":"Best practice","date":"2021-03-03 15:35:00 +7","topics":"CSS"},"prevPost":{"slug":"return-an-object-in-an-arrow-function-quickly","title":"Return an object in an arrow function quickly"},"nextPost":{"slug":"run-the-last-command-as-the-root-user","title":"Run the last command as the root user"}},"__N_SSG":true}
